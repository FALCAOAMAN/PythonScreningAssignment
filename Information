Implementation of Abstract Class and decorators:

Employee Package has four classes and a main file:

1. Employee --> It is an abstract class that return fullname of the employee and calculates salary.
                Both the methods are made abstract methods using decorators.

2. FulltimeEmployee --> This class inherits from the Employee class. It’ll provide the implementation for
                 the get_salary() method. Since full-time employees get fixed salaries, you can initialize
                 the salary in the constructor of the class.

3. HourlyEmployee --> It also inherits from the Employee class. However, hourly employees get paid by working hours
                      and their rates. Therefore, you can initialize this information in the constructor of the class.
                      To calculate the salary for the hourly employees, you multiply the working hours and rates.

4.Payroll --> This class will have a method that adds an employee to the employee list and print out the payroll. Since
              fulltime and hourly employees share the same interfaces (full_time property and get_salary() method).
              Therefore, the Payroll class doesn’t need to distinguish them.
